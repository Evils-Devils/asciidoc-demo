== A demo for {url-project}[RFC 0064]
https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/64

I'm fairly new to asciidoc, i definitely think it's better than markdown, especially for this application. +
Don't take any shortcomings in this demo as being due to asciidoc unless a source can be found for this.

== An example of code blocks
// this isn't intended to be a valid nix file...
.test.nix
[source,nix]
----
{ stdenv, lib
, callPackages
}:

let
  tests = callPackages ./tests.nix; # <1> <2>
in
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  src = ./source;
  buildInputs = tests;
  meta.license = licenses.bsd3;
};
----
<1> callPackages accepts multiple attribute sets, see https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ex-hello-composition-co-3[here]
<2> the callouts in the codeblock are not links... https://discuss.asciidoctor.org/callouts-with-link-functionality-td7390.html[nor can they be?]

== Clarissa
// this has to be defined at the start of a section
:clar: {pkgsdir}/tools/networking/clarissa/default.nix
Sourced from its actual file

.{clar}
[source,nix,linenums,highlight]
----
include::{clar}[]
----
<2> updates available https://gitlab.com/evils/clarissa[here]
<3> this is <3> adoc fixes this numbering and warns about mismatches

=== Description
[source,indent=0]
----
include::{pkgsdir}/tools/networking/clarissa/default.nix[lines=24..26]
----
TIP: not sure how to supply the line numbers, but that's nix specific... +
or the specific filepath...

=== options
*TODO* +
i don't know how the options are currently extracted +
and don't want to waste a few hours figuring it out ðŸ˜†

They are defined link:{nixosdir}/modules/services/networking/clarissa.nix[here]

ifndef::env-github[]
== ommited github section was here
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
== optional block
This block is only shown if this file is shown in github. +
